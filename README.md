# Complete-Chains-HPML
This code is part of my Ph.D. research. The objective is to test the best chosen hybrid partitions with silhouette coefficient. A version HPML where both internal and external chaining is performed. This is a joint version of Label Chains HPML and Cluster Chains HPML. Therefore, there is the chaining of labels and clusters.
